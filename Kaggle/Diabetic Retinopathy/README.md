The purpose of this project is to train a deep learning model that can scan human retinas and make a conclusion of the severity of diabetic retinopathy. The dataset is made up of 3553 colored images of human retinas, each belonging to one of five categories indicating severity (NO_DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, & Proliferate_DR). When tested, the deep learning model will make a prediction on the category that a picture belongs to. 

This project in specific utilizes a residual neural network (resnet).
